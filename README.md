This repository is for my project while learning Kotlin MultiPlatform from [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-multiplatform-masterclass/).

I will get used to KMM by following the instructor's actions.

After that course, I will proceed with Phillip Lackner's [KMM playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCQxZMQdhR2_TNYa-jwnXUGJ)
